## Execution Time and Performance Analysis

The execution time of the Assembly Function was measured for 10 * 10, 100 * 100, 1000 * 1000. The test is run 30 times to get the average execution time. Below are the results:

| Method          | Average Execution Time (seconds) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 10*10 | 0.0064       |
|  100*100  | 0.8682333    |
|  1000*1000  | 64.9069    |
